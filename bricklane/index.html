                    Bricklane is an investment platform powered by expertly chosen property portfolios. I enjoyed working with the team
                    over
                    a period of months on a range of impactful projects that covered the key parts of their user experience (their
                    website,
                    signup flow & dashboard) and included everything from day-to-day UX tweaks to larger design projects.

                    I’m also a software engineer and all the projects mentioned
                    on this page were then implemented by me (typically using a mixture of React, TypeScript & Python). I also worked
                    on some engineering-only projects whilst at Bricklane.

                <h2 class="text-heading">Designing a better property page</h2>

                <p>
                    Bricklane enables users to invest in a entire property portfolio but existing research suggested this was not
                    obvious when viewing individual properties on <a href="https://bricklane.com">bricklane.com</a>. In addition, the team felt more could be done to show off their
                    properties, which are chosen carefully and lovingly photographed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My brief was to redesign the way individual properties appear on the Bricklane website to more effectively (and proudly)
                    display each property and communicate how it forms part of the product.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tom, the design head and Bricklane co-founder (who provided direction throughout the project) gave me an initial starting point — he imagined something similar to a 'playlist' where users
                    viewing any individual property would understand it was just one of many other properties within a easily navigable collection.
                </p>

                    <img class="img shadow" src="images/1.jpg">

                        <img class="camera-icon" src="images/camera-icon.svg"/>
                        <span class="image-caption">The existing property page design</span>
                    </small>
                </div>

                <p>
                    I began digging through <a href="https://rightmove.co.uk">various</a> <a href="https://zoopla.co.uk">well-known</a> <a href="https://www.themodernhouse.com/">listings sites</a> to get a better sense of the conventions used for displaying
                    properties. I also looked at other investment platforms to better understand the design language used for stocks, shares and funds.
                </p>

                <div class="margin-bottom-large">
                    <img class="img shadow bordered" src="images/2.jpg">
                    <small class="text-base image-caption-container">
                        <img class="camera-icon" src="images/camera-icon.svg" />
                        <span class="image-caption">An example page from <a href="https://robinhood.com/">robinhood.com</a></span>
                    </small>
                </div>

                <p>
                    I spotted the opportunity for immediate improvement by moving the property page contents into the
                    same layout as other pages on the marketing site, so that any visitors would actually see the Bricklane
                    brand and easily navigate to other site sections. This change would naturally result in including the stylish typography
                    & components consistent with other landing pages; it would give space to show off the beautiful photography; and it
                    would provide more room to spell out the unique value of Bricklane.

                    The ‘fund’ component evolved during the project as a way of clearly explaining that Bricklane offers investments
                    in city portfolios rather than individual properties whilst also illustrating the impressive volume of superior
                    properties that Bricklane owns. As part of the wider story told by the new page design, this component (which
                    called back to the original 'playlist' idea) also provided a natural opportunity to invite users to begin
                    the signup process.

                <p>
                    I asked for regular feedback from Tom to make sure my ideas were on the right track
                    and informed by his years of gathering Bricklane user insights. After a healthy amount
                    of discussion & revisions I arrived at the final design, shown below.

                <p>
                    I designed and implemented an update to the Bricklane signup flow that provided users with
                    predefined investment amounts to choose from when signing up, rather than a plain text input.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also designed and implemented statements that provide Bricklane customers with
                    a detailed breakdown of their investment totals & performance to date.
